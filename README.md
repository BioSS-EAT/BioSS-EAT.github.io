A website for "Inference tools for epideiological and analytical modelling" (the iTEAM). This provides a collection of tools for analysing epidemiological data:

* **BICI** - General purpose point and click software for both simulating from compartmental models as well as performing inference on individual-based and population wide data.

* **SIRE** - Software for estimating genetic and non-genetic factors determing epidemiological traits.

* **PAC** - Used in conjunction with SIRE, this simple online tool allows the user to estimate the statistical power from a given disease transmission experiment.

These tools have been developed from a collaboration between Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland (BioSS) and the Roslin Institute (University of Edinburgh). This research has been funded through the Scottish Government's Rural and Environment Science and Analytical Services Division (RESAS).
